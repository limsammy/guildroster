# Attendance Team View - Specifications & Implementation Plan

## Overview

Transform the current attendance page from a simple list view to a comprehensive team-based table view that shows toons as rows and raids as columns, with historical attendance data and percentage calculations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM and Alembic migrations
- **API**: FastAPI with comprehensive attendance endpoints
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, existing attendance page with list view
- **Authentication**: Token-based system with superuser and regular user roles
- **Models**: Attendance, Raid, Toon, Team, Guild models with proper relationships

### Current Attendance Page Issues
- Simple list view doesn't provide historical context
- No team-based organization
- Difficult to see attendance patterns across multiple raids
- No percentage calculations
- Limited filtering options

## Feature Specifications

### 1. Team-Based Organization
- **Guild Dropdown**: Only visible to superusers, allows switching between guilds
- **Team Dropdown**: Shows teams for the selected guild, with "All Teams" option
- **Context Awareness**: Regular users only see teams from their current guild

### 2. Table View Structure
- **Rows**: Toons (characters) from the selected team(s)
- **Columns**: 
  - Toon Name (fixed)
  - Overall Attendance % (fixed)
  - Last N raids (configurable: 5, 10, 15, 20)
- **Attendance Status Indicators**:
  - ‚úÖ Present (Green)
  - ‚ùå Absent (Red)
  - üü° Benched (Yellow)
  - * = Has note (displayed on hover)

### 3. Attendance Percentage Calculation
- **Formula**: `Present / (Total Raids - Benched)`
- **Exclusion**: Benched status does not count as absent
- **Display**: Percentage with color coding (green for high, yellow for medium, red for low)

### 4. Historical Data Management
- **Default View**: Last 5 raids
- **Pagination**: Increment by 5 (5, 10, 15, 20 raids)
- **Lazy Loading**: Load additional raid data as needed
- **Sorting**: Raids sorted by date (newest first)

### 5. Interactive Features
- **Tooltips**: Show attendance notes on hover
- **Star Indicator**: (*) for benched status with notes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly card view
- **Horizontal Scrolling**: For many raid columns

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend API Enhancements

#### 1.1 New Team View Endpoint
**Endpoint**: `GET /attendance/team-view/{team_id}`
**Purpose**: Return toons with their attendance data for the last N raids

**Request Parameters**:
- `team_id` (path): Team ID to view
- `raid_count` (query): Number of raids to include (default: 5)
- `guild_id` (query): Guild ID for superuser filtering (optional)

**Response Structure**:
```json
{
  "team": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Team Alpha",
    "guild_id": 1
  },
  "toons": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "username": "Player1",
      "class": "Warrior",
      "role": "Tank",
      "overall_attendance_percentage": 85.0,
      "attendance_records": [
        {
          "raid_id": 5,
          "raid_date": "2024-01-15T20:00:00Z",
          "status": "present",
          "notes": "On time",
          "has_note": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "raids": [
    {
      "id": 5,
      "scheduled_at": "2024-01-15T20:00:00Z",
      "scenario_name": "Mythic Amirdrassil"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 1.2 Enhanced Stats Calculation
**Update**: `GET /attendance/stats/toon/{toon_id}`
**Changes**: Modify percentage calculation to exclude benched from denominator

**New Calculation**:
```python
# Old: attendance_percentage = present / total_raids
# New: attendance_percentage = present / (total_raids - benched)
```

#### 1.3 Guild Context Support
**New Endpoint**: `GET /guilds/{guild_id}/teams`
**Purpose**: Get teams for a specific guild (superuser only)

### Phase 2: Frontend Component Development

#### 2.1 New Attendance Team View Component
**File**: `frontend/app/components/AttendanceTeamView.tsx`
**Features**:
- Team-based table layout
- Guild/team dropdowns
- Raid pagination controls
- Responsive design
- Tooltip system

#### 2.2 Enhanced Filtering Controls
**Components**:
- `GuildDropdown.tsx` (superuser only)
- `TeamDropdown.tsx`
- `RaidCountSelector.tsx`

#### 2.3 Attendance Table Component
**File**: `frontend/app/components/AttendanceTable.tsx`
**Features**:
- Dynamic column generation
- Status indicators with tooltips
- Percentage display with color coding
- Horizontal scrolling support

### Phase 3: Data Management & Performance

#### 3.1 Lazy Loading Strategy
- **Initial Load**: Last 5 raids for selected team
- **Progressive Loading**: Load additional raids on demand
- **Caching**: Cache loaded data to prevent redundant API calls

#### 3.2 State Management
- **Team Selection**: Track selected team/guild
- **Raid Count**: Track number of raids to display
- **Loading States**: Handle loading states for different data fetching operations

## Database Schema Considerations

### Existing Schema Review
The current attendance schema supports all required features:
- `AttendanceStatus` enum (present, absent, benched)
- `notes` and `benched_note` fields for tooltip content
- Proper relationships with Raid, Toon, and Team models

### No Schema Changes Required
The existing database structure can support all planned features without modifications.

## API Endpoints to Create/Modify

### New Endpoints
1. `GET /attendance/team-view/{team_id}` - Team view with attendance data
2. `GET /guilds/{guild_id}/teams` - Get teams for guild (superuser)

### Modified Endpoints
1. `GET /attendance/stats/toon/{toon_id}` - Update percentage calculation
2. `GET /attendance/stats/team/{team_id}` - Update percentage calculation
