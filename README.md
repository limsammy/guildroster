## Overview

Briefly describe what your application does, its purpose, and the main use cases.

## Features

- FastAPI-powered RESTful API
- Interactive API docs (Swagger UI & ReDoc)
- [Add more features here]

## Tech Stack

- `Python 3.13.5`
- `FastAPI`
- `Uvicorn` (ASGI server)
- `Pytest`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Docker`
- `SQLAlchemy`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- `Python 3.13.5`
- `PostgreSQL`
- `Docker`
- `psycopg2`
- `Alembic` (for database migrations)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/limsammy/guildroster.git
cd guildroster
pyenv virtualenv 3.13.5 guildroster
pyenv activate guildroster
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running Locally (Development)

From the project root, start the development server with:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

- The API will be available at: `http://localhost:8000`
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`  # TODO: Not yet implemented

**Note:**
- Always run Uvicorn from the project root and use the correct module path (`main:app`).
- If you see an error like `Could not import module "main"`, it usually means you are either in the wrong directory or using the wrong import path. Double-check your working directory and the command.

## API Documentation

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API docs:

- **Swagger UI:** `/docs`
- **ReDoc:** `/redoc`

## Project Structure

├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py

```

- The `app/` directory contains the FastAPI application code.
- The `tests/` directory contains test modules, organized by `features/` and `models/` subdirectories.


### App Factory Pattern

This project uses the **app factory design pattern** for creating the FastAPI application instance. The factory function `create_app` is located in `app/__init__.py`. The main entrypoint for running the app is `main.py` at the project root, which imports and uses this factory.

#### Example Usage

```python
from app import create_app

app = create_app()
```

- In production, the app factory is called by the ASGI server (e.g., Uvicorn or Gunicorn) via `main.py`.
- In tests, you can call `create_app(test_config)` to inject test-specific settings.

### Benefits
- Clean separation of configuration and initialization
- Easier to test and extend
- Flexible for different environments

## Schema

Here is the schema for the database with the tables and their relationships (Designed with [wwwsqldesigner](https://github.com/ondras/wwwsqldesigner)):

![Schema](./schema.png)

### Schema Description

The GuildRoster database schema is designed to manage guilds, teams, members, raids, attendance, and an invite-based signup system for a World of Warcraft guild environment. Here’s an overview of the main tables and their relationships:

- **Invites**:  
  Stores invite codes generated by superusers for new user signups. Tracks which superuser created the invite (`created_by`), which user redeemed it (`used_by`), creation and usage timestamps (`created_at`, `date_used`), and whether the invite is still active.

- **Users**:  
  Stores user account information, including username, password, invite code used for signup, superuser status, and the guilds they belong to. Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`). The `invite_code` field links to the code used from the Invites table.

- **Guilds**:  
  Represents a guild, with a name and relationships to its members and teams. Each guild can have multiple members and teams. Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Members**:  
  Represents individual guild members, storing their display name and Discord username. Each member can have multiple toons (characters). Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Toons**:  
  Represents a character (toon) belonging to a member. Each toon has a username and a flag indicating if it is the member’s main character. Toons are linked to attendance records for raids. Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Teams**:  
  Represents a team within a guild, with a name and relationships to its members and raids. Teams are used to organize members for specific raid groups or activities. Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Raids**:  
  Represents a scheduled raid event, including the date/time, scenario (raid instance), difficulty, and size. Each raid is associated with a team and has attendance records for participating toons.  
  - **scenario_id**: Foreign key to the Scenarios table (lookup table/enum for raid instances).
  - **difficulty**: Enum representing the difficulty level of the raid (e.g., Normal, Heroic, Mythic).
  - **size**: Enum representing the size of the raid group (e.g., 10, 25, 40).
  Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Attendance**:  
  Tracks which toons attended which raids, and whether they were present or absent. Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

- **Scenarios**:  
  Lookup table (or enum) representing different raid scenarios or instances (e.g., specific dungeons or raid zones). Tracks creation and update timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`).

#### Relationships

- **Invites ↔ Users**:  
  Each invite is created by a superuser (`created_by`) and, once used, is linked to the user who redeemed it (`used_by`). Users reference the invite code they used to sign up.

- **Users ↔ Guilds**:  
  An account can have many guilds.

- **Guilds ↔ Members**:  
  A guild has many members.

- **Guilds ↔ Teams**:  
  A guild can have many teams.

- **Members ↔ Toons**:  
  A member can have many toons (characters).

- **Teams ↔ Members**:  
  Teams are composed of many members.

- **Teams ↔ Raids**:  
  Each team can participate in many raids.

- **Raids ↔ Scenarios**:  
  Each raid is associated with a scenario (raid instance) from the lookup table.

- **Raids ↔ Attendance ↔ Toons**:  
  Attendance records link toons to raids, tracking their presence.

## Testing

To run tests, ensure you are in the project root directory and use:

```bash
pytest
```

To measure test coverage, this project uses [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/). Run:

```bash
pytest --cov=app
```

If you encounter import errors (e.g., `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`), run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) pytest
```

- All test directories should contain an `__init__.py` file for best compatibility.
- Test discovery and imports are set up for standard Python and pytest usage.

## Deployment
